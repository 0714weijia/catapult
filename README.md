Catapult
========

Catapult is currently under construction! But when it is here, it will be a set
of tools for performance analysis, testing, and monitoring:
 * [Trace-viewer](
    https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/trace-event-profiling-tool)
 * [Telemetry](https://www.chromium.org/developers/telemetry)
 * [Performance Dashboard](https://chromeperf.appspot.com/)

These tools were created by Chromium developers for performance debugging and
testing of Chrome, but they can also be used for analyzing and monitoring
websites, and eventually Android apps.
